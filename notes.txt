<!-- HTML Follows BEM naming conventions 
  IDs are only used for sections to connect menu achors to sections -->

    <!-- Navigation starts as empty UL that will be populated with JS -->

    <!-- Each Section has an ID (used for the anchor) and 
    a data attribute that will populate the li node.
    Adding more sections will automatically populate nav.
    The first section is set to active class by default -->
